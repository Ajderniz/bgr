PROJECT SOLO #0201 / MUGWUMP

'player' is a structure of the form (x, y, found?)
'players' is a set of four 'player's

START
fill 'players' with random positions (x, y)
while current turn is under 10 AND not all players have been found:
	ask user for a 'guess' in the form (x, y)
	if the 'guess' matches a 'player' in 'players':
		and if said 'player' has not been found yet:
			mark this 'player' as found
		else, if this 'player' has already been found:
			say "already found"
	say how far away from the 'guess' each unfound 'player' in 'players' is
		using the pythagorean theroem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2)
	if a 'player' has been found, say so instead
outside of the main loop
if not all 'player's in 'players' were found:
	say "fail"
	ask user if they want to know where each unfound 'player' was
	if yes, say the x and y values of each 'player' in 'players'
ask user if they want to replay
if yes, go back to START
